<h1>Continuous Localization</h1>

<p>Localization is undoubdetly important in a globalized world, so why so few companies have their products localized properly? The main reason is that historically the management overhead that localization brings into product lifecycle adds a whole new layer of complexity, so people are instinctively avoiding it. Things can get even more complex with agile product development cycle, when there are frequent software releases, and a constant inflow of new material to translate, review and publish.</p>

<p>Continuous localization revolutionizes this process much like continous build integration revolutionized software development process. <strong>It is a way of automatically, seamlessly gathering new source material, publishing it for translation, acquiring translations and integrating them back into the product.</strong> Ultimately, it makes manual localization management — exporting, converting files, sending them for translation, doing backward conversion, committing changes to version control — unnecessary.</p>

<p>Imagine that developers only ever need to deal with one source language, and — magically! — see all localized resources being updated in their version control system by a tireless localization robot as soon as translations arrive. This is excatly what Serge helps to achieve. Building robust multi-platform multilingual products in agile development environment suddenly becomes a manageable goal.</p>
