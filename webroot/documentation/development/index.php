<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>At its core, Serge is a <a href="/documentation/help/serge/">command-line tool</a> that can be either run manually and on demand on a developers' computer, or be run continuously on a standalone server. After you have it <a href="/download/">downloaded and installed</a>, you can simply run it by saying `<code>serge</code>` in the command line, which will give you a quick help and a list of available commands. The general command syntax is:</p>

<code class="block"><a href="/documentation/help/serge/">serge</a> <em><a href="#commands">&lt;command&gt;</a></em> <em><a href="#config-files">&lt;configuration-file-or-directory&gt;</a></em></code>
